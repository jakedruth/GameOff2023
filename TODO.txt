[ ] Remove the use of interfaces
	based on a hunch, it is the cause of godot not being able to
	complete the assembly reloading properly. It is potentially the 
	use of c# based resources. Which would suck...

[x] Add a system for switching things on and off
	A switch can set the on/off state of an object
	[x] Interactable
	[x] Switch

[ ] Add a button ???
	Preforms an action, like always setting the state of an object to on

[ ] Create one time directional walls/doors
	Probably uses a button of sorts

[x] Collapsable platforms

[x] Add exit goal

[x] Add a key system

[ ] Expand the state machine
	[ ] Add a push state
	[ ] Add a jump/ airborn state

[ ] Add water physics
	possible good tutorial

[ ] Saving and Loading
	Completed levels

[x] Main Menu
	Play & Quit
	Maybe options if I have time.
		Sound Mixer
		Resolution? (Maybe just keep as a window that can be resized)

[ ] Level Select Menu
	Display if beat or not

[ ] Implement the vertical slice
	This includes starting a level and selecting which scale to use.
	Handle saving the level layout inbetween finishing a level.
